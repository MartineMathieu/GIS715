<h1>Styling maps with QGIS (Part 2)</h1>
<img src="https://martinemathieu.github.io/GIS715/QGIS/Wildfire.png" alt="2020 Wildfire_Western">
<p> I wanted to visualize 2020 wildfire events that happened in the Western of the US. I'm interesting in this data because wilfire is a primay source of Particulate Matter with an aero diameter equals or less than 2.5 micrometers. So I used two datsets: wildfire events for 2020 represented by area marks and US state data to be able to localize in which state each event happened. In the Layer Styling panel, I selected Addition for the Feature blending mode in order to highlight areas where wildfire events overlapped in 2020 (the closer to 255 the RGB values become, so that the most dense areas become white). </p>
