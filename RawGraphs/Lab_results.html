<figcaption>Fig.1: Orchestra instruments</figcaption>
<p> We used Orchestra data and followed instructions from the tutorial. As requested by 
  the assignment instructions, 5 colors have been chosen using Colorgorical. 
  However, I tried to display the sum per type of instruments, but it didn't work. </p>

<figcaption>Fig.3: Relationship between number of rooms in a household and using stove with fuel </figcaption>
<p> The data used are from the Energy Information Administration's 2015 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) which is a nationally representative sample of housing units. We only used 2 columns "Number of rooms" and "Households with a stove using fuel". Because it's a large dataset, I chose to visualize the distribution and correlation of the data using a contour plot that shows estimated density of point clouds. </p>
